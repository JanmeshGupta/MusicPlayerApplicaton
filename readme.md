Here's the outline for the following project:

1.  Create a new Android project in your preferred development environment (e.g., Android Studio).
2.  Set up the necessary permissions in the app's manifest file to access the device's storage and play audio files.
3.  Create a layout file (e.g., activity_main.xml) to define the user interface of the app. It should include the following components:
    TextView to display the current song name
    Button for previous song
    Button for play/pause
    Button for next song
    SeekBar for seeking through the song
4.  In your activity class (e.g., MainActivity.java), implement the necessary logic to control the audio playback and seek functionality.
    Declare the MediaPlayer object to handle audio playback.
    Implement a method to initialize the MediaPlayer and set up event listeners for the media controls.
    Implement a method to update the seek bar progress based on the current position of the MediaPlayer.
    Implement event listeners for the previous song, play/pause, and next song buttons to control the playback.
    Implement an event listener for the seek bar to handle user seeking.
    Implement a method to skip forward and backward by 10 seconds when the corresponding buttons are pressed.
5.  Load the MP3 files from the device's storage or provide a mechanism to select the MP3 files for playback (e.g., using a file picker dialog).
6.  When a song is selected, update the TextView to display the current song name and start playing the selected MP3 file using the MediaPlayer.
7.  Update the seek bar progress and keep it synchronized with the current position of the MediaPlayer.
8.  Implement the necessary error handling, such as checking for null objects, handling exceptions, and releasing the MediaPlayer when the app is paused or stopped.
